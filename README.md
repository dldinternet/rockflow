# Rockflow

What is rockflow? Well with rockflow you are able to define workflows (yes even parallel workflows) by writing simple small steps and aggregating them in your flow (the bigger picture... you know)

Let's start the tour:

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rockflow'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rockflow

## Usage

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
